          <li>Homework will <strong>not</strong> be accepted past the late cutoff. You will receive a 0 for the assignment if it is not turned in by the late cutoff.</li>
          <li>If you are not sure whether you can finish the assignment by the late cutoff, you should turn it in before the deadline anyway to get partial credit. You are allowed to update your GitHub homework submission as many times as you need to before the late cutoff.</li>
